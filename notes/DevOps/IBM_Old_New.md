Just like **IBM Rational Test Workbench (RTW)** being rebranded as **IBM DevOps Test Workbench (DTW)**, several other IBM Rational tools have also been integrated, evolved, or renamed over time to align with modern **DevOps**, **Agile**, and **continuous testing** practices. The core functionalities often remain the same, but the tools have undergone changes in their branding and integration with IBM’s DevOps strategy.

Here's how the evolution has happened for tools like **Rational Functional Tester (RFT)**, **Rational Performance Tester (RPT)**, and **Rational Test Control Panel (RTCP)**:

### 1. **IBM Rational Functional Tester (RFT)**
**RFT** is IBM's tool for **automated functional testing** of applications across a variety of platforms such as desktop, web, and mobile. It has traditionally been used for creating and executing automated test scripts.

#### Current State and Evolution:
- **RFT** is still actively used but is often **integrated under the broader umbrella of IBM’s DevOps tools**. It is **not renamed**, but it is often marketed as part of IBM’s broader **DevOps Test** solutions, including **IBM DevOps Test Workbench**.
- It is designed to work in tandem with other tools for continuous testing in a DevOps environment.
- It now features tighter **integration with CI/CD pipelines** to allow automated functional tests to be executed as part of the continuous delivery process.
  
In summary, RFT remains a key component of IBM’s testing tools, but it's positioned as part of the broader **DevOps testing framework** rather than being a standalone tool. It retains its original name.

### 2. **IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT)**
**RPT** is IBM’s tool for **performance and load testing**. It allows teams to simulate user activity and analyze how applications perform under stress.

#### Current State and Evolution:
- Similar to **RFT**, **RPT** has retained its name but is often grouped under the larger **DevOps testing umbrella**.
- It has evolved to support modern architectures (e.g., **cloud-native** applications, APIs, microservices) and can be tightly integrated with DevOps pipelines for **continuous performance testing**.
- **RPT** is often used alongside tools like Jenkins or UrbanCode Deploy to ensure performance validation is integrated into **automated delivery**.

In essence, **RPT** remains relevant and is actively used, but like RFT, it’s integrated into IBM’s modern DevOps toolchain for continuous testing. The focus is now on integrating performance testing into the CI/CD process, ensuring applications perform well across environments.

### 3. **IBM Rational Test Control Panel (RTCP)**
**RTCP** is a web-based server used for **managing and monitoring virtual services** and test environments. It is heavily utilized for **service virtualization** in complex testing environments where real services might not always be available or practical to use.

#### Current State and Evolution:
- **RTCP** has retained its core functionality but has been repositioned under the broader **IBM DevOps testing framework**. In particular, it's a key part of **IBM Rational Test Virtualization Server (RTVS)**.
- Like RTW (now DTW), RTCP has evolved to play a more critical role in **continuous testing** and **DevOps pipelines** by enabling automated, virtualized environments that allow for faster testing cycles.
  
While the name **RTCP** hasn’t been significantly altered, the tool now aligns with IBM’s **DevOps-focused testing suite**. It is essential for managing virtual services within automated testing pipelines.

### **Summary of Current Tools and Naming Trends**:

| **Original Tool**                     | **Current Status / Branding**                       | **Focus**                                           |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Rational Functional Tester (RFT)**  | **Retains the name** but integrated into DevOps Test tools | Functional test automation; CI/CD integration       |
| **Rational Performance Tester (RPT)** | **Retains the name** but positioned in DevOps Testing | Performance and load testing; integrated with CI/CD |
| **Rational Test Control Panel (RTCP)**| **Retains the name** as part of DevOps Test tools   | Service virtualization management and monitoring    |
| **Rational Test Workbench (RTW)**     | **Rebranded as IBM DevOps Test Workbench (DTW)**    | Continuous testing, full DevOps integration         |

### Key Takeaways:
- **RFT**, **RPT**, and **RTCP** retain their original names but have shifted to align with **DevOps practices**.
- They are now components of a **larger DevOps testing suite**, emphasizing **continuous testing**, **automation**, and **integration** with CI/CD pipelines.
- **RTW** was explicitly **rebranded as IBM DevOps Test Workbench**, reflecting IBM's strategy to align with modern software development practices like Agile and DevOps.

In essence, the tools you mentioned haven’t been entirely renamed (except for RTW to DTW), but their roles have evolved within the context of **DevOps and continuous testing** frameworks. They are now seen as part of an integrated solution that fits seamlessly into the modern **continuous integration and delivery** pipelines.
